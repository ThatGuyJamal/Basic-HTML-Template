# HTML-Template

First try build a website with coding only.

# Why is this public?

Do give others a good/basic stgarting point on website building.

# How to run on local host:?

There are many ways you can setup the html/css website. I used vscode to build it and the extrention live server. But all you need is to open a browner link of the `index.html` file. When this is done you can view the html in your brower. If you want to learn how to host it online then google it as this can only run locally.
