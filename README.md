# HTML-Template

First try build a website with coding only.

#How to setup?

There are many ways you can setup the html/css website. I used vscode to build it and the extrention live server. But all you need is to open a browner link of the `index.html` file

```
If anyone build off my project feel free to use it any (legal) way you like. No credit needed!
```

Build date: 17/1/21
